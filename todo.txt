- INLINE word (forces inlining)

- dead code and inlining optimizations can't distinguish words that have same name
	- therefore the compiler does not really support defining multiple words with same name
	-> raise an error when a word is redefined and document the behavior in README

- can we support inlining for machine code words?
	- yes, but we need to relocate the compiled code (patch all absolute jumps)

- document remaining words in README

- can we make machine code version of . any faster (it's really slow)?
	- yes, write specializations for base 10 and base 16?

- BUG: errors and warnings have incorrect line number for words at the end of the line
	- store last_word_line in next_symbol

- formatting of negative literals in listing files is broken

- BUG: empty comments are not parsed correctly! Compiling the following code causes an error:
: foo ( ) ;
: bar ( 0 ) ;
: main bar ;

- mcode optimizations:
	- eliminate rst 16 (push word) & rst 24 (pop word) pairs (there's bound to be a lot of them!)
	- similarly dup and ?dup can be much simplified if they are following rst 16 (push word)
	- alternatively we could always hold top of stack in de
		- we only need to push de to stack when we call another word, or when we return/exit from mcode word

- in-out-crash in mcode.f

- add to compile_dict and mcode_dict: 2DUP 2DROP 2OVER NIP 2* 2/ HEX R@
	- R@ is just an alias for I'

- SCF sets carry flag, it should probably be used in mcode (at least in MIN and MAX?)

- separate control flow stack
	- check that the stack is empty at the end of word definition

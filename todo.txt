- forward gotos could be optimized to branches

- starfield.lst contains garbage in listing:
	40d8 cd b9 3c 14 00 53 54 41 43 4b 20 47 55 41 52 44 call $3cb9
	40e8 20 46 41 49 4c 45 44 21 20

- relocate inlined machine code

- dead code and inlining optimizations can't distinguish words that have same name
	- therefore the compiler does not really support defining multiple words with same name
	-> raise an error when a word is redefined and document the behavior in README

- document remaining words in README

- can we make machine code version of . any faster (it's really slow)?
	- yes, write specializations for base 10 and base 16?

- BUG: errors and warnings have incorrect line number for words at the end of the line
	- store last_word_line in next_symbol

- formatting of negative literals in listing files is broken

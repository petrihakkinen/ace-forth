- words marked with IMMEDIATE cannot be called from :m words
	- also POSTPONE probably does not work correctly
	
- can we support inlining for :m words?
	- record Forth source of each colon definition and play them back when inlining

- erase_literal for IN and OUT

- short forward branches for IF, ELSE and GOTO

- eliminate mcode wrappers for :m definitions that are not called from Forth?

- would byte size arithmetic make sense? C+ C- C< C>

- document remaining words in README

- extract long & rarely used mcode words to subroutines:
	2OVER ROLL SPACES 0> MIN MAX ABS

- any mcode word that uses stk_pop_bc can be made faster by extracting the code to subroutine and inlining stk_pop_bc there

- can we make machine code version of . or at least call it without call_forth?

- [HEX] STK! STK?

- document warnings in README

- add xx00 specialization (e.g when adding SCREEN address)

- BUG: errors and warnings have incorrect line number for words at the end of the line
	- store last_word_line in next_symbol

- formatting of negative literals in listing files is broken

- consider replacing :m with option that compiles all words to machine code
	- no need for mcode wrappers and --no-forth-mcode-calls option
	- makes things simpler to understand
	- we could probably also eliminate all word headers and just compile everything into one word

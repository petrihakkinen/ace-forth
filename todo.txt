- would byte size arithmetic make sense? C+ C- C< C= C>

- BUG: test/mcode.f does not compile with --optimize
	test/mcode.f:27: undefined word 'chk2'

- BUG: 2DUP test fails if chk2 is defined with :m

- document remaining words in README

- extract long & rarely used mcode words to subroutines:
	2DUP 2OVER ROLL SPACES > < 0> MIN MAX ABS

- any mcode word that uses stk_pop_bc can be made faster by extracting the code to subroutine and inlining stk_pop_bc there

- BUG: OVER benchmark crashes
	- probably because it does not clear data stack

- BUG: one of the +LOOP tests fail
	*** this does not happen if current edits are stashed ***

- can we make machine code version of . or at least call it without call_forth?

- [HEX] STK! STK?

- warning: "+LOOP with non-literal step produces inefficient code!"

- --no-warn option

- document warnings in README

- add xx00 specialization (e.g when adding SCREEN address)

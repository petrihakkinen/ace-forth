- would byte size arithmetic make sense? C+ C- C* C< C= C> CXOR CAND COR

- BUG: test/mcode.f does not compile with --optimize
	test/mcode.f:27: undefined word 'chk2'

- BUG: 2DUP test fails if chk2 is defined with :m

- document remaining words in README

- extract long & rarely used mcode words to subroutines:
	2DUP 2OVER ROLL LOOP SPACES > < 0> MIN MAX ABS

- fast loops: -LOOP

- implement mcode version of +LOOP

- any mcode word that uses stk_pop_bc can be made faster by extracting the code to subroutine and inlining stk_pop_bc there

- stack benchmark crashes

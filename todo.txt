- can we support inlining for machine code words?
	- yes, but we need to relocate the compiled code (patch all absolute jumps and string references)

- document remaining words in README

- any mcode word that uses stk_pop_bc can be made faster by extracting the code to subroutine and inlining stk_pop_bc there

- can we make machine code version of . or at least call it without call_forth?

- document warnings in README

- BUG: errors and warnings have incorrect line number for words at the end of the line
	- store last_word_line in next_symbol

- formatting of negative literals in listing files is broken

- would byte size arithmetic make sense? C+ C- C< C= C>

- BUG: 2DUP test fails if chk2 is defined with :m

- document remaining words in README

- extract long & rarely used mcode words to subroutines:
	2DUP 2OVER ROLL SPACES > < 0> MIN MAX ABS

- any mcode word that uses stk_pop_bc can be made faster by extracting the code to subroutine and inlining stk_pop_bc there

- can we make machine code version of . or at least call it without call_forth?

- [HEX] STK! STK?

- document warnings in README

- add xx00 specialization (e.g when adding SCREEN address)

- BUG: errors and warnings have incorrect line number for words at the end of the line
	- store last_word_line in next_symbol

- formatting of negative literals in listing files is broken

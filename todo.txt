- implement :M ("define macro")

- remove remains of IMMEDIATE
	
- can we support inlining for machine code words?
	- yes, but we need to relocate the compiled code (patch all absolute jumps and string references)

- optimization idea: when compiling to machine code, we could probably eliminate all word headers and just compile everything into one word

- short forward branches for IF, ELSE and GOTO

- would byte size arithmetic make sense? C+ C- C< C>

- document remaining words in README

- extract long & rarely used mcode words to subroutines:
	2OVER ROLL SPACES 0> MIN MAX ABS

- any mcode word that uses stk_pop_bc can be made faster by extracting the code to subroutine and inlining stk_pop_bc there

- can we make machine code version of . or at least call it without call_forth?

- [HEX] STK! STK?

- document warnings in README

- add xx00 specialization (e.g when adding SCREEN address)

- BUG: errors and warnings have incorrect line number for words at the end of the line
	- store last_word_line in next_symbol

- formatting of negative literals in listing files is broken

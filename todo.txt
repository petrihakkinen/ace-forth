- BUG: empty comments are not parsed correctly! Compiling the following code causes an error:
: foo ( ) ;
: bar ( 0 ) ;
: main bar ;

- mcode optimizations:
	- eliminate rst 16 (push word) & rst 24 (pop word) pairs (there's bound to be a lot of them!)
	- similarly dup and ?dup can be much simplified if they are following rst 16 (push word)
	- alternatively we could always hold top of stack in de
		- we only need to push de to stack when we call another word, or when we return/exit from mcode word

- in-out-crash in mcode.f

- add to compile_dict and mcode_dict: 2dup 2drop 2over nip 2* 2/ hex
